### A Data Science/Computer Science content aggregator
A content aggregator to collect data science/machine
learning and computer science/programming resources

#### Current TODOs: (they will get more specific as I learn more)
* Create a frontend using flask - this will present
the different resources in tiles.
* Develop the actual backend which will constitute 
a scraping script to get data from the sites of 
interest.
* Incorporate a database to store links, images, headings, 
and later retrieve them.
* Add functionality to allow user to log in and 
therefore maintain a history of viewed pages, or
liked content, etc

#### Look into this
* The bootstrap version has something to do with the reoccuring error
of the body overlapping with the body. I'll look into it later
