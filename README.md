### A Data Science/Computer Science content aggregator
A content aggregator to collect data science/machine
learning and computer science/programming resources

#### Current TODOs: Priorities
* ~~Develop the scraping backend~~
    * Library used: **Scrapy**
* Potential Data Science Sources: 
    * ~~**[Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/)**~~

* ~~Create frontend to display the results of our aggregator and incorporate a database to store links, images, headings, 
and later retrieve them.~~
    * Library used: **Flask**
* Schedule crawls to update the aggregator when new content is added
* Add more websites to the database
* Migrate to other database
* Deploy on server - Dock container / AWS, etc

#### Other TODOs: Non-priorities
* Figure out multi-select (to filter by several sources instead of just one)
* Figure out sorting by date
* Add functionality to allow user to log in and therefore maintain a history of viewed pages, or
liked content, etc
