### A Data Science/Computer Science content aggregator
A content aggregator to collect data science/machine
learning and computer science/programming resources

#### Current TODOs: (they will get more specific as I learn more)
* Develop the scraping backend
    * Library used: **Scrapy**
* Potential Data Science Sources: 
    * **[Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/)**
    * **[KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/news/index.html)**
    * **[Data Science Central](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/)**
    * **[Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/)**
    * **[Kaggle 'No Free Hunch'](https://medium.com/kaggle-blog)**
    * **[Lazy Programmer](https://lazyprogrammer.me/)**
    * **[Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)**
* Potential Programming/Dev Sources:
    * **[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/archives/)**
    * **[CodePen Blog](https://blog.codepen.io/)**
    * **[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/articles/)**
    * **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/)**
    * **[The Crazy Programmer](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/)**
    * **[Stack Abuse](https://stackabuse.com/)**
    * **[Better Programming](https://medium.com/better-programming)**
* Create frontend to display the results of our aggregator and incorporate a database to store links, images, headings, 
and later retrieve them.
    * Library used: **Flask**
* Add functionality to allow user to log in and 
therefore maintain a history of viewed pages, or
liked content, etc

#### Look into this
* The bootstrap version has something to do with the reoccuring error
of the body overlapping with the body. I'll look into it later
